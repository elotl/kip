## Pod Annotations

Kip supports a number of annotations to customize the cloud instance that pods are launched onto.

**pod.elotl.co/instance-type**


Kip will attempt to run a pod on the cheapest cloud instance that satisfies the resouce requests and limits specified by the pod.  Use the `instance-type` annotation to specify a specific cloud instance type the pod will run on.  The annotation will override requested container limits.  It's possible to include a wildcard '*' in the instance type name to specify a family of instances instead of a specific instance type.  The pod will run on the cheapest instance type that satisfies the pod's resource requests that matches the wildcard expression.

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/instance-type: c5.large
```

```yaml
# select the cheapest c5 instance that satisfies the resource
# requests/limits specified in the pod.
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/instance-type: c5*
```

**pod.elotl.co/launch-type**

Kip will run pods using OnDemand instances.  Set the `launch-type` annotation to `Spot` to run a pod on a spot instance

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/launch-type: spot
```

**pod.elotl.co/private-ip-only**

In AWS, Kip cells will get a public IP address if the cell is run in a subnet connected to an internet gateway.  Set the private-ip-only annotation to "true" instruct kip to run the pod on a cell without a public IP address.  The subnet must be configured to allow downloading the itzo binary and container images without a public IP on the cell.

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/private-ip-only: 'true'
```

**pod.elotl.co/security-groups**

Use the `security-groups` annotation to set one or more security groups on the cloud instance the pod is running on.  If multiple security groups are specified, they should be separated by a comma.  Each cloud instance started by Kip cell has one security group assigned to it by the Kip controller.  In most AWS accounts, instances are limited to 5 security groups.  In those setups, that would leave room for 4 more security groups to be assigned to the cloud instance.

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/security-groups: sg-0011a33dcc0da8151, sg-0026179f4abedb34a
```

**pod.elotl.co/instance-profile**

AWS Instance profiles can be attached to the instances backing Kip cells.  At this time, instance profiles must be specified by using the full ARN of the profile

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/instance-profile: "arn:aws:iam::11123456789:instance-profile/kip-s3-full-access-role"
```

**pod.elotl.co/healthcheck-healthy-timeout**

Use this annotation to change the healthcheck timeout for individual pods from the value specified in provider.yaml. If a pod doesn't have a healthy response to healthcheck probes for greater than healthcheck-timeout the pod will be terminated and restarted according to the pod's restartPolicy.  A healthcheck-timeout of zero means the pod will not be terminated due to failing healthchecks.

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/healthcheck-healthy-timeout: "300"
```

**pod.elotl.co/cloud-route**

This annotation can be used to add one or more routes to the cloud subnet route table.  The value must be one or more CIDRs separated by whitespace, e.g. "10.20.30.40/24 192.168.1.0/28". Route to these CIDRs, using the instance as the next hop, will be added to the route table of the subnet.

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/cloud-route: "10.20.30.40/24 192.168.1.0/28"
```

**pod.elotl.co/volume-size**

PodVolumeSize is an annotation tells kip to resize the root partition of the pod's cell to the specified size in bytes. The size can be expressed as a plain integer or as a fixed-point integer using one of these suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, K. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki. Disks cannot be resized to be smaller than the defaultVolumeSize specified in provider.yaml. Cloud providers sell disks in GiB increments, the value will be rounded up to the nearest GiB

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/volume-size: "12G"
```

**pod.elotl.co/image-overlay-rootfs**

Use this annotation to inform kip whether to use an overlayfs when setting up container images within Itzo. Set this annotation to a truthy value to denote the use of overlayfs, and to a falsy value to have the image layers extracted for the rootfs without using overlayfs.

```yaml
annotations:
  pod.elotl.co/image-overlay-rootfs: "false"
```
