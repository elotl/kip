// or container instance node

// kubernetes pods to tell kip to use a specific instance type for
// the node the pod will be launched onto. This annotation will
// override specified resource requests and limits.

// PodImageOverlayRootfs is an annotation users add to their
// kubernetes pods to inform kip whether the itzo cell will use
// -mount or -extractto argument when itzo calls tosi to pull rootfs
// images. This annotation will default to -mount if its value is empty
// or truthy, if the value is falsy it will use the -extractto option.

// PodVolumeSize is an annotation tells kip to resize the root
// partition of the pod's cell to the specified size in bytes. The
// size can be expressed as a plain integer or as a fixed-point
// integer using one of these suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, K. You can also
// use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki. Disks
// cannot be resized to be smaller than the defaultVolumeSize
// specified in provider.yaml. Cloud providers sell disks in GiB
// increments, the value will be rounded up to the nearest GiB

// to the instance backing their pod.

// healthcheck timeout for pods. If a pod doesn't have a healthy
// response to healthcheck probes for greater than healthcheck-timeout

// will not be terminated due to failing healthchecks.

// route table. The value must be one or more CIDRs separated by whitespace,
// e.g. "10.20.30.40/24 192.168.1.0/28". Route to these CIDRs, using the
// instance as the next hop, will be added to the route table of the subnet.
